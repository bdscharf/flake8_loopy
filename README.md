basic code quality checks in loops

```pip install flake8_loopy```

## checks
| error code      | description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| LPY100      | unused variable created by ```enumerate()```: you probably do not need ```enumerate()```, or you should use ```range(len())``` instead      |

## todo
1) check for duplicated variable name in inner loop(s)

2) iteration with index where index is only used to get an item (should iterate directly over items)


## notes
this plugin is currently mostly untested and should be considered experimental. please report false positives / errors if found!
